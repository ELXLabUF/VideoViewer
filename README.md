# VideoViewer
Notes for using:
Path change has 2 button, "browse" and "change".
Browse means it will pop up a windows file explorer dialog and you will choose the path using GUI,
Change means you need to type in/copy the path from the file explorer by yourself, and then click change button to apply the change, the video list will automaticly update.

Play all is the button in the bottom.
If you click it, it will play non-stop from the video that is currently playing to the last video.
You have the freedom to choose which video to start with (before you click "play all".
However, once it starts, there's no way to change video playing as it's queued task. I can modify this but I think it's not necessary for current situation as you just need to close the program and restart again so it will be reset.

Also, although you have the freedom to change the path once the program runs, please put the default videos in the path "C:\testingvideos" for the program to initialize.
